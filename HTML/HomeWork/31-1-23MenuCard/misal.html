        <p> Misal is prepared in part with sprouted lentils and has less water content and a watery, spicy "cut" or
            "bite". It has two parts, a thick curry of matki, called usal, and watery gravy, also called rassa. Usually
            people mix these two according to their taste and requirement. When moth beans are unavailable, it is
            sometimes prepared using mung beans. It may be garnished with Indian snack noodles. The moth curry or usal
            form is prepared using onion, ginger, garlic and other spices.
