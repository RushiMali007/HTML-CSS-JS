        <p> According to K. T. Achaya, Vadai (Vada) was popular among ancient Tamils during 100 BCE â€“ 300 CE. A type of
            vada is mentioned as "vataka" in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara
            III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka. In this recipe, green beans are soaked, de-skinned, and ground to
            a paste. The paste is shaped into balls and deep-fried. Early literature from the present-day states of
            Bihar and Uttar Pradesh also mentions bara (vada) and mungaura (a vada made from mung).
