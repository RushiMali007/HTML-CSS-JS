                <p>Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and a former <br>
                    chairman of Tata Sons. He was also chairman of Tata Group, from 1990 to 2012, and again, as interim <br>
                    chairman, from October 2016 through February 2017, and continues to head its charitable trusts. He is <br>
                    the recipient of two of the highest civilian awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan (2008) and Padma <br>
                    Bhushan (2000). He is well known for his business ethics and philanthropy.</p>
                <p>Born in 1937, he is a scion of the Tata family, and great-grandson of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of <br>
                    Tata Group. He is an alumnus of the Cornell University College of Architecture and Harvard Business <br>
                    School through the Advanced Management Program that he completed in 1975. He joined his company in 1961 <br>
                    when he used to work on the shop floor of Tata Steel, and was the apparent successor to J. R. D. Tata <br>
                    upon the latter's retirement in 1991. During Ratan Tata's chairmanship of 21 years, revenues grew over <br>
                    40 times, and profit, over 50 times.He got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar <br>
                    Land Rover, and Tata Steel to acquire Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centrist <br>
                    group into a global business.</p>
                <p>Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, on 28 December 1937,and is the son of Naval Tata (born in <br>
                    Surat). His biological maternal grandmother had been the sister of Hirabai Tata, wife of group founder <br>
                    Jamshedji Tata. His biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, had belonged to the broader Tata family; <br>
                    Ratan therefore was a Tata by birth. Parents Naval and Sonoo separated in 1948 when Ratan was 10, and he <br>
                    was subsequently raised by the widow of Sir Ratanji Tata, his grandmother, Navajbai Tata, who formally <br>
                    adopted him through the J. N. Petit Parsi Orphanage. He has a half-brother, Noel Tata (from Naval Tata's <br>
                    second marriage with Simone Tata), with whom he was raised. His first language is Gujarati.</p>
                <p>He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class, followed by Cathedral and John Connon <br>
                    School, Mumbai and at Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and, in 1955, graduated from Riverdale Country <br>
                    School in New York City. In 1959, he then received a degree in Architecture from Cornell University, and <br>
                    in 1975, attended the seven-week Advanced Management Program of Harvard Business School â€” an institution <br>
                    which he has since endowed.</p>
                <p>Tata is a supporter of education, medicine and rural development, and considered a leading <br>
                    philanthropist in India. Tata supported University of New South Wales Faculty of Engineering to develop <br>
                    capacitive deionization to provide improved water for challenged areas.</p>
                <p>Ratan Tata received the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and Padma Vibhushan in 2008, the third and second <br>
                    highest civilian honours awarded by the Government of India.</p>
