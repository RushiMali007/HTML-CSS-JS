            There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and
            continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the Oxford English Dictionary a
            mountain is defined as "a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the
            surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or
            notable.
